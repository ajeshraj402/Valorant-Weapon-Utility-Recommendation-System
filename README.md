# Valorant-Weapon-Utility-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a data-driven recommendation system designed for the popular tactical shooter game Valorant. The goal of this project is to provide intelligent suggestions for weapon and utility purchases based on the game's economic and strategic conditions, with a focus on the agent ISO.

Libraries Used:
python: 3.12.6
pandas: 2.2.3
matplotlib: 3.10.0
scikit-learn: 1.6.0

Software Used:
VS Code: 1.96.2
Juypter Notebook extension

Features:
Agent-Specific Recommendations: Tailored to ISO's abilities and utilities.
Dynamic Insights: Suggests purchases based on round economy, current loadout, and match conditions.
Data-Driven Approach: Leverages match data to train a recommendation model for accurate predictions.
Scalable Framework: Designed to support additional agents and features in future iterations.

Project Objectives:
Create a portfolio-worthy project showcasing data science and machine learning skills.
Build a robust system that mimics real-world decision-making in Valorant matches.
Provide actionable recommendations for:
Weapon purchases (sidearms and main weapons).
Utility usage (passive, basic, signature, and ultimate abilities).

Project Workflow:

1. Data Collection:
Manually recorded data for agent ISO over 3 matches, including:

  Round number
  Economy after purchase
  Minimum economy for the next round
  Sidearms and main weapon
  Utilities (passive, basic)
  Match outcome (round win/loss, match victory/defeat)

2. Data Processing:
Cleaned and structured the data for training and testing.
Explored data to understand correlations and trends.

3. Model Training:
Developed a machine learning model to predict optimal purchases and strategies.

4. System Development:
Built a recommendation engine based on the trained model.
Designed to offer recommendations during gameplay scenarios.

Future Enhancements:
Expand support for additional agents and maps.
Incorporate team strategies and opponent behavior for more sophisticated recommendations.
Develop a web-based interface for accessibility.
Automate data collection to streamline the process.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Machine Learning: For recommendation modeling.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: Data visualization.
